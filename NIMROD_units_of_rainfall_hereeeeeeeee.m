function [ status ] = NIMROD_wintest1( dirname )
%NIMROD_WINTEST1 Demo function for decompressing, reading and displaying a 
%set of BADC - UK MetOffice NIMROD composite uk-1km radar data files (V1.7)
% This program is suitable only for running under MS Windows versions of
% MATLAB; However, adaptation to unix platforms should be relatively
% simple.
% TYPICAL MATLAB COMMAND TO CALL THIS FUNCTION:
% status = NIMROD_wintest1( 'NIMRODdata\2007-08-19to2007-08-21\20' );
%
% ASSUMPTIONS:  
%   1) Files have been downloaded from BADC website in *.gz compressed 
%   format; 
%   2) Program 7-zip is used to unzip each *.gz compressed file.
%   NB: If you do not have 7-zip (7z.exe) installed on your PC, you will
%   need to modify the 'lcommand' and 'uzcommand' entries below to use a
%   suitable alternative file decompression program, or download and
%   install 7-zip in C:\Program Files\7-Zip directory.
%   3) This program has been tested on MATLAB V 2010a (64-bit) -it may work
%   on other versions!
%   4) Directory 'dirname' contains the NIMROD uk-1km composite data files  
%   of interest and is on the current MATLAB path (I used a subdirectory
%   of the current directory where both *.m files were. 'dirname' then just
%   contained a relative path from the current directory).
%   5) For NIMROD composite uk-1km data files, there is just one file in 
%   each *.gz archive file. This contains a snapshot of the entire UK 
%   est Total Precipitation Rate, 1 pixel per 1km square, corresponding 
%   to Ordnance Survey National Grid squares, for a period of 5-minutes. 
%   There is a header of 523 bytes, followed by a rectangular integer array
%   of estimated Precipitation Rates; a value of 1 in an array location 
%   corresponds with 1/32 of a mm of rain per hour (valid for the 5-minute 
%   reference period).
%
% DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
%   A listing of the *.gz files in directory passed in 'dirname' is taken;
%   A MATLAB figure is created for the resultant radar data plots;
%   Each compressed *.gz file is unzipped in turn (into the current 
%   directory) prior to reading in the unzipped file data; 
%   Each unzipped file is deleted to save space;
%   Each radar data 5-min image is displayed in the above figure, using 
%   axes corresponding to the Ordnance Survey National Grid. Note that the
%   y-data have to be plotted in reverse order to ensure image is displayed
%   correct way up and y-axis scale is displayed correctly using axis xy.
%   A yellow square (20x20 pixels) is included in the image in the top 
%   right hand corner, to help ensure it is being displayed the right way 
%   round. NB: Remove the code for this, when no longer needed.
%   The clims parameter used for the imagesc command limits the colours
%   diplayed in the plot to 0 (no rain) -(although some cells will actually
%   contain negative values) <= 1000, which corresponds with intensity of
%   1000/32 = 31.25mm/hr. The maximum possible value from the data array is
%   +32767/32 = 1024mm/hr, so clims can be changed if studying very intense
%   rainstorms, but less intense ones will not be visible in this case.
%   It is possible to overlay an outline of Great Britain over the top of
%   the display by using 'plot' statements to plot a vectorised outline.
%   The outline data are available for download from OS Edina website:
%   http://edina.ac.uk/ukborders/
%   They have not been included here due to copyright considerations.
%   An example location is marked with a white 'x', for illustration.
%   For this, OS 6-digit easting and 6-digit northing national grid values 
%   should be used. More information can be found at: 
%   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_national_grid_reference_system
